### Setup
I probably forgot some things but here are some useful peices of informaiton
* We use docker because it made it easier to install things like fortran
* You need to install docker locally
* the docker file is based on the miniconda one found at https://github.com/heroku-examples/python-miniconda/blob/master/Dockerfile
* The instructions for using docker with Heroku were found at https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/container-registry-and-runtime


to deploy: heroku container:push web
